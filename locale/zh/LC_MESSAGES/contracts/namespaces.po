"For a blockchain solution of internet scale to be realizable, it, like "
"the internet, must possess a logic to reason about the “location” of a "
"resource. Specifically, how do we reference a resource? How do we "
"determine which agents can access that resource under what conditions? "
"In contrast to many other blockchains, where addresses are flat public "
"keys (or hashes thereof), RChain’s virtual address space will be "
"partitioned into namespaces. **In a very general explanation, a "
"namespace is a set of named channels.** Because channels are quite often "
"implemented as data stores, a namespace is equivalently a set of "
"contentious resources."
